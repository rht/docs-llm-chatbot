# 1. How do I configure LDAP authentication in Zulip?
https://github.com/zulip/zulip/tree/main/docs/production/authentication-methods.md

To configure LDAP authentication in Zulip, you need to do the following:

1. Fill out the section of your /etc/zulip/settings.py headed "LDAP integration, part 1: Connecting to the LDAP server".
2. If a password is required, put it in /etc/zulip/zulip-secrets.conf by setting auth_ldap_bind_password.
3. Decide how you want to map the information in your LDAP database to users' account data in Zulip.
4. Tell Zulip how to map the user information in your LDAP database to the form it needs for authentication.
5. Enable the zproject.backends.ZulipLDAPAuthBackend auth backend, in AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS in /etc/zulip/settings.py.
6. Restart the Zulip server with /home/zulip/deployments/current/scripts/restart-server so that your configuration changes take effect.

You can test your configuration using manage.py query_ldap. Once you're happy with the configuration, you can synchronize data declared in AUTH_LDAP_USER_ATTR_MAP from LDAP into Zulip, via the following management command:

```
/home/zulip/deployments/current/manage.py sync_ldap_user_data
```

This will sync the fields declared in AUTH_LDAP_USER_ATTR_MAP for all of your users. We recommend running this command in a regular cron job, to pick up changes made on your LDAP server.

# 2. How do I import Slack workspace export into a Zulip organization?
https://github.com/zulip/zulip/blob/main/docs/production/export-and-import.md

To import a Slack workspace export into a Zulip organization, you can use the logical data export tool provided by Zulip. This tool produces a .tar.gz archive with most of the Zulip database data encoded in JSON files, which is a format shared by the data import tools for third-party services like Slack. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Export your Slack workspace data using the Slack export tool.
2. Install a new Zulip server with the same version as the server where the Slack data was exported from.
3. Use the logical data export tool to import the Slack data into the new Zulip server. You can do this by running the following command on the new server:
```
/home/zulip/deployments/current/manage.py import --destroy-rebuild-index /path/to/slack-export.tar.gz
```
Note that the --destroy-rebuild-index flag is used to rebuild the search index after the import is complete.

Once the import is complete, you can configure the new Zulip server as needed and start using it with the imported data.

# 3. How do I upgrade my Zulip instance to the latest Git version?

To upgrade your Zulip instance to the latest Git version, you can follow the standard upgrade process by creating a new deployment under /home/zulip/deployments/ containing a complete copy of the Zulip server code, and then moving the symlinks at /home/zulip/deployments/{current,last,next} as part of the upgrade process. Once you have the new version deployed, you can run /home/zulip/deployments/last/scripts/restart-server to start the new version. If you have modified any service configuration files installed by Zulip, you should save a copy of those files before upgrading and then restore them after the upgrade. Additionally, you should check if there are any hooks in /etc/zulip/pre-deploy.d and /etc/zulip/post-deploy.d that you need to run before or after the upgrade.

# 4. How do I create a self-signed SSL certificate for my Zulip server?

To create a self-signed SSL certificate for your Zulip server, you can use the generate-self-signed-cert script provided by Zulip.

If you are installing Zulip for the first time, you can pass the --self-signed-cert flag when running the install script.

If you have already installed Zulip, you can run the following command as root:

```
sudo -s
/home/zulip/deployments/current/scripts/setup/generate-self-signed-cert HOSTNAME
```

Replace HOSTNAME with the domain name or IP address to use on the generated certificate. After replacing the certificates, you need to reload nginx by running the following as root:

```
service nginx reload
```

However, note that self-signed certificates are not recommended for production use as they are insecure. The Zulip desktop and mobile apps will not connect to a server if they cannot validate its SSL certificate.

# 5. How do I delete a Zulip organization?
To delete a Zulip organization, you can use the ./manage.py delete_realm command. If you are hosting the organization on a subdomain, you should replace '' with the subdomain. Assuming you want to delete the organization on the root domain, you can run the following command:

```
./manage.py delete_realm -r ''
```

Please note that this command will permanently delete all data from the organization, including all messages, files, and user accounts. If you're using the local file uploads backend, you can also delete all file uploads, avatars, and custom emoji on the Zulip server (across all organizations) with the following command:

```
rm -rf /home/zulip/uploads/*/*
```

After running these commands, the organization will be completely deleted from the Zulip server.

# 6. Can you explain the rough working of Zulip?

Zulip is a messaging platform that allows users to communicate with each other through streams and topics. It uses various subsystems such as caching, queuing, and databases to ensure reliable and efficient communication. Redis is used for short-term data storage, primarily for rate-limiting, while RabbitMQ is used for queuing expensive work that requires reliable delivery. PostgreSQL is used as the primary database. Zulip also has a well-defined process for contributing to its development, and user feedback is an essential part of its feature development.

# 7. Can you describe Zulip architecture, as in, its inner working?

Zulip is a real-time team chat application that provides a great experience for a wide range of organizations. It has hundreds of features and supports dedicated apps for iOS, Android, Linux, Windows, and macOS, all modern web browsers, several cross-protocol chat clients, and numerous dedicated Zulip API clients (e.g., bots). A server can host multiple Zulip realms (organizations), each on its own (sub)domain. While most installations host only one organization, some host thousands, such as zulip.com. Each organization is a private chamber with its own users, streams, customizations, and so on. The main Zulip codebase is at https://github.com/zulip/zulip. It contains the Zulip backend (written in Python 3.x and Django), the web app (written in JavaScript and TypeScript) and our library of incoming webhook integrations with other services and applications. Zulip is primarily implemented in the Django Python web framework. We also make use of Tornado for the real-time push system. Django is the main web application server; Tornado runs the server-to-client real-time push system. The app servers are configured by the Supervisor configuration and the nginx configuration. We use supervisord to start server processes, restart them automatically if they crash, and direct logging. Memcached is used to cache database model objects. Redis is used for a few very short-term data stores, primarily our rate-limiting system. RabbitMQ is a queueing system. Its config files live in zulip/puppet/zulip/files/rabbitmq. We use RabbitMQ for queuing expensive work that requires reliable delivery but which we don't want to do on the main thread. It's also used for communication between the application server and the Tornado push system.

# 9. How do I get an account's username via the Zulip Python API?
# 10. How I set up a bot for Zulip?

To set up a bot for Zulip, you can follow the instructions provided in the Zulip API documentation. The documentation provides step-by-step instructions on how to create a bot, generate an API key, and run the bot. Once you have created the bot and generated the API key, you can use it to interact with the Zulip API and perform various tasks, such as sending messages, creating streams, and subscribing users to streams. If you have any questions or run into any issues while setting up your bot, you can ask for help in the Zulip development community.
