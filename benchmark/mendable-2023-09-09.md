# 1. How do I configure LDAP authentication in Zulip?
Looks like what you are looking for can be found in full [here](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/tree/main/docs/production/authentication-methods.md)

To configure LDAP authentication in Zulip, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have an installed Zulip server and are logged into a shell there. You can have created an organization already using EmailAuthBackend, or plan to create the organization using LDAP authentication.
2. Connect Zulip to your LDAP server:
  - Fill out the section of your /etc/zulip/settings.py headed "LDAP integration, part 1: Connecting to the LDAP server".
  - If a password is required, put it in /etc/zulip/zulip-secrets.conf by setting auth_ldap_bind_password. For example: auth_ldap_bind_password = abcd1234.
3. Decide how you want to map the information in your LDAP database to users' account data in Zulip. For each Zulip user, two closely related concepts are:
  - Their email address. Zulip needs this in order to send, for example, a notification when they're offline and another user sends a PM.
  - Their Zulip username. This means the name the user types into the Zulip login form. You might choose for this to be the user's email address (sam@example.com), or look like a traditional "username" (sam), or be something else entirely, depending on your environment.
4. Map the user information in your LDAP database to the form it needs for authentication. There are three supported ways to set up the username and/or email mapping:
  - Using email addresses as Zulip usernames, if LDAP has each user's email address:
  - Make AUTH_LDAP_USER_SEARCH a query by email address.
  - Set AUTH_LDAP_REVERSE_EMAIL_SEARCH to the same query with %(email)s rather than %(user)s as the search parameter.
  - Set AUTH_LDAP_USERNAME_ATTR to the name of the LDAP attribute for the user's LDAP username in the search result for AUTH_LDAP_REVERSE_EMAIL_SEARCH.
  - Using LDAP usernames as Zulip usernames, with email addresses formed consistently like sam -> sam@example.com:
  - Set AUTH_LDAP_USER_SEARCH to query by LDAP username
  - Set LDAP_APPEND_DOMAIN = "example.com".
  - Using LDAP usernames as Zulip usernames, with email addresses taken from some other attribute in LDAP (for example, mail):
  - Set AUTH_LDAP_USER_SEARCH to query by LDAP username
  - Set LDAP_EMAIL_ATTR = "mail".
  - Set AUTH_LDAP_REVERSE_EMAIL_SEARCH to a query that will find an LDAP user given their email address (i.e. a search by LDAP_EMAIL_ATTR). For example:
    ```
    AUTH_LDAP_REVERSE_EMAIL_SEARCH = LDAPSearch("ou=users,dc=example,dc=com",
    ldap.SCOPE_SUBTREE, "(mail=%(email)s)")
    ```
  - Set AUTH_LDAP_USERNAME_ATTR to the name of the LDAP attribute for the user's LDAP username in that search result.
5. Test your configuration by running the following command from the root of your Zulip installation:
```
/home/zulip/deployments/current/manage.py query_ldap username
```
If your configuration is working,

# 2. How do I import Slack workspace export into a Zulip organization?
Looks like what you are looking for can be found in full [here](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/tree/main/docs/production/export-and-import.md)

To import a Slack workspace export into a Zulip organization, follow these steps:
1. Generate a Slack workspace export from your Slack organization settings. Slack only allows workspace administrators to export data.
2. Unzip the downloaded Slack export.
3. Run the following command on your Zulip server:
   ```
   ./manage.py convert_slack_data <slack_data_dir> <realm_name> --token=<token> --output=<output_dir>
   ```
   Replace <slack_data_dir> with the path to the unzipped Slack workspace export directory, <realm_name> with the name of your Zulip realm, <token> with your Slack API token, and <output_dir> with the directory where you want the converted data to be stored.
4. This will create a new directory under <output_dir> named after the Slack workspace that was converted. This new directory contains all the data from the Slack workspace in a format that can be imported into Zulip.
5. To import the converted data into a Zulip organization, run the following command:
   ```
   ./manage.py import --realm=<realm_name> --slim-mode --threads=0 <output_dir>/<slack_workspace_name>
   ```
   Replace <realm_name> with the name of your Zulip realm, and <slack_workspace_name> with the name of the Slack workspace that was converted.
6. After the import is complete, you should be able to see all the data from the Slack workspace in your Zulip organization.

Please note that the import process may take some time depending on the size of your Slack workspace.

# 3. How do I upgrade my Zulip instance to the latest Git version?

To upgrade your Zulip instance to the latest Git version, you can use the upgrade-zulip-from-git script. However, before you proceed, please note that the upgrade scripts are idempotent, meaning you can run them multiple times without causing any harm. If you encounter any issues during the upgrade, the most common causes are networking issues or out-of-memory issues, especially on systems with minimal RAM for running Zulip.

Here are the steps to upgrade your Zulip instance:
1. Shut down the Zulip server to free up RAM. You can do this by running the following command:
   ```
   ./scripts/stop-server
   ```
2. Run the upgrade-zulip-from-git script. This script will fetch the latest version from the Git repository and start the upgrade process.

If you encounter any issues during the upgrade, you can check the logs for more information. The Zulip upgrade scripts log all output to /var/log/zulip/upgrade.log, and the Zulip server logs all Internal Server Errors to /var/log/zulip/errors.log.

If the new version isn't working, you can quickly downgrade to the old version by running /home/zulip/deployments/last/scripts/restart-server, or to an earlier previous version by running /home/zulip/deployments/DATE/scripts/restart-server. The restart-server script stops any running Zulip server, and starts the version corresponding to the restart-server path you call.

If you need help and don't have a support contract, you can visit #production help in the Zulip development community server for best-effort help. Please include the relevant error output from the above logs in a Markdown code block in any reports.

# 4. How do I create a self-signed SSL certificate for my Zulip server?

To create a self-signed SSL certificate for your Zulip server, you can use OpenSSL, a robust, full-featured open-source toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols.

Here are the steps to create a self-signed SSL certificate:

Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to create the certificate and key.

Run the following command to generate a new private key:

openssl genrsa -out zulip.key 2048
Now, create a self-signed certificate using the private key:
openssl req -new -x509 -key zulip.key -out zulip.cert -days 365
You will be prompted to enter details like country, state, etc. These will be embedded in the certificate.

Now, you have a self-signed certificate zulip.cert and a private key zulip.key. You need to set these in your Zulip settings. Open /etc/zulip/settings.py in a text editor and find the settings EXTERNAL_HOST, ZULIP_CERTIFICATE, and ZULIP_PRIVATE_KEY. Set them as follows:
EXTERNAL_HOST = '<your-zulip-domain>'
ZULIP_CERTIFICATE = '/path/to/zulip.cert'
ZULIP_PRIVATE_KEY = '/path/to/zulip.key'
Replace <your-zulip-domain> with your Zulip server's domain and /path/to/zulip.cert and /path/to/zulip.key with the actual paths to your certificate and key files.

Finally, restart your Zulip server for the changes to take effect.
Please note that while a self-signed certificate will encrypt communication between your users and the server, it will not verify the server's identity. This could leave your users vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. For a production Zulip server, it's recommended to use a certificate signed by a trusted certificate authority (CA).

# 5. How do I delete a Zulip organization?
Looks like what you are looking for can be found in full [here](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/tree/main/docs/production/export-and-import.md)

To delete a Zulip organization, you need to have server-level access because this action cannot be performed from the Zulip UI. Here are the steps:
1. SSH into your Zulip server.
2. Run the following command to get into the Zulip environment:
   ```
   /home/zulip/deployments/current/scripts/zulip-py3-venv
   ```
3. Now, run the following command to delete the organization:
   ```
   ./manage.py delete_realm --realm=<your_zulip_domain>
   ```
    Replace <your_zulip_domain> with your Zulip server's domain.

Please note that this action is irreversible. Once you delete an organization, all data associated with it will be permanently deleted.

# 6. Can you explain the rough working of Zulip?

Zulip is an open-source chat application that combines the immediacy of real-time chat with the productivity benefits of threaded conversations. It is designed to help teams collaborate more effectively.

Here's a rough explanation of how Zulip works:
1. Streams and Topics: Zulip organizes conversations into streams and topics. Streams are like channels in other chat applications, and they can be joined or left by users. Each stream can have multiple topics. Topics are similar to conversation threads, and they keep conversations organized. Every message in a stream has a topic.
2. Sending Messages: When you send a message in Zulip, you choose a stream and a topic for your message. This helps keep conversations organized and allows users to follow or mute specific topics that are of interest or irrelevant to them.
3. Receiving Messages: When you receive a message in Zulip, you can immediately see which stream and topic it belongs to. This helps you understand the context of the message without reading the entire conversation.
4. Searching Messages: Zulip has powerful search functionality. You can search for messages by stream, topic, sender, date, and more. This makes it easy to find specific conversations or messages.
5. Integrations: Zulip supports integrations with many tools and services. This allows you to receive notifications and updates directly in Zulip, reducing the need to switch between different applications.
6. Notifications: Zulip has flexible notification settings. You can choose to receive notifications for all messages, only messages that mention you, or only messages from certain streams or topics.
7. Privacy and Security: Zulip takes privacy and security seriously. All data is encrypted both at rest and in transit. Administrators have control over who can join the server and access specific streams.
8. Open Source: Zulip is open source, which means you can self-host your own Zulip server, and you can contribute to the development of Zulip.

In summary, Zulip's unique model of organizing conversations into streams and topics helps teams have more structured and productive conversations. It's designed to help you manage the complexity of multiple ongoing conversations without feeling overwhelmed.

# 7. Can you describe Zulip architecture, as in, its inner working?

Zulip's architecture is designed to be robust, scalable, and efficient. It is built on a variety of open-source technologies and follows a client-server model. Here's a brief overview of its architecture:
1. Client-Server Model: Zulip follows a client-server model. The server hosts the Zulip application and manages all data, while clients (users) interact with the server through the Zulip user interface. Clients can be web browsers, mobile apps, or even bots.
2. Backend: The backend of Zulip is primarily written in Python using the Django framework. It handles tasks such as authentication, data storage, message sending and receiving, and more. The backend also includes a RESTful API that allows other applications to interact with Zulip.
3. Frontend: The frontend of Zulip is built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It uses the React and jQuery libraries for building the user interface and managing user interactions. The frontend communicates with the backend through AJAX requests.
4. Database: Zulip uses PostgreSQL as its primary database. It stores all persistent data, including user information, messages, streams, and topics.
5. Real-Time Updates: Zulip uses Tornado, a Python web server, and RabbitMQ, a message broker, to handle real-time updates. When a message is sent, the server pushes the update to all connected clients in real time.
6. Caching and Queuing: Zulip uses Memcached and RabbitMQ for caching and queuing respectively. Caching improves performance by storing frequently accessed data in memory, reducing the need for database queries. Queuing ensures that tasks are processed in an orderly manner, improving efficiency.
7. Full-Text Search: Zulip uses PostgreSQL's full-text search capabilities to provide powerful search functionality. Users can search for messages by content, sender, date, stream, topic, and more.
8. Email Integration: Zulip has built-in email integration. It can send notifications via email when users are offline, and users can reply to these emails to send messages in Zulip.
9. Authentication: Zulip supports various authentication methods, including email, Google, GitHub, LDAP, SAML, and more. It also supports two-factor authentication for added security.
10. Markdown and Emoji Support: Zulip supports Markdown for text formatting and has a comprehensive set of emojis. This allows for rich, expressive conversations.
11. Bots and Integrations: Zulip supports bots and integrations with other services. Bots can automate tasks and respond to certain messages, while integrations allow Zulip to work with other tools and services.

In summary, Zulip's architecture is designed to be robust, scalable, and efficient. It leverages a variety of open-source technologies to provide a powerful, flexible chat platform.

# 8. Can you describe an overview of Zulip architecture?

Zulip is a real-time team chat application that is designed to provide a great experience for a wide range of organizations. It has hundreds of features and supports dedicated apps for iOS, Android, Linux, Windows, and macOS, all modern web browsers, several cross-protocol chat clients, and numerous dedicated Zulip API clients.

Zulip's architecture is primarily composed of the following components:
1. Django and Tornado: Django is the main web application server, while Tornado runs the server-to-client real-time push system. Django processes parts that are activated relatively rarely (e.g. when people type or click on something), while Tornado is responsible for event (message) delivery.
2. HTML templates, JavaScript, etc.: Zulip's HTML is primarily implemented using two types of HTML templates: backend templates (powered by the Jinja2 template engine) and frontend templates (powered by Handlebars) used for live-rendering HTML from JavaScript for things like the main message feed.
3. nginx: nginx is the front-end web server to all Zulip traffic; it serves static assets and proxies to Django and Tornado. It handles HTTP requests according to the rules laid down in the many config files found in zulip/puppet/zulip/files/nginx/.
4. Supervisor: Zulip uses supervisord to start server processes, restart them automatically if they crash, and direct logging.
5. memcached: memcached is used to cache database model objects. zerver/lib/cache.py and zerver/lib/cache_helpers.py manage putting things into memcached, and invalidating the cache when values change.
6. Redis: Redis is used for a few very short-term data stores, primarily Zulip's rate-limiting system.
7. RabbitMQ: RabbitMQ is a queueing system used for queuing expensive work that requires reliable delivery but which Zulip doesn't want to do on the main thread. It's also used for communication between the application server and the Tornado push system.
8. PostgreSQL: Zulip uses PostgreSQL as its primary database.

In addition to these, Zulip also has separate repositories for integrations and other glue code, including Python API bindings, JavaScript API bindings, a Hubot adapter, integrations with Phabricator, Jenkins, Puppet, Redmine, Trello, and many more.

# 9. How do I get an account's username via the Zulip Python API?

(Review: wrong reference, but correct answer)

Looks like what you are looking for can be found in full [here](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/tree/main/docs/production/authentication-methods.md)

To get an account's username via the Zulip Python API, you would typically use the get_profile method. However, it's important to note that you need the user's API key to make this request. Here's a simple example:

```python
import zulip

# Pass the path to your zuliprc file here.
client = zulip.Client(config_file="~/zuliprc")

# Get the profile of the user/bot that the client is logged into
result = client.get_profile()
print(result)
```

In the response, you'll find the email field which is the username of the account in Zulip. Please note that Zulip uses email addresses as usernames.

Remember to replace "~/zuliprc" with the path to your zuliprc file. The zuliprc file is a configuration file that holds your Zulip server and API key. You can download it from your Zulip server.

Please note that you should keep your API key safe. If it is accidentally compromised, you can rotate it from the settings page.

# 10. How I set up a bot for Zulip?
(Review: misformatted Markdown)

To set up a bot for Zulip, you need to follow these steps:
1. Create a bot in Zulip: You can create a new bot by visiting the "Add new bot" section in the "Settings" page of your Zulip account. After creating the bot, you will be provided with a bot API key. This key is used to authenticate the bot with the Zulip server.
2. Install Zulip's Python API: You can install the Zulip Python API using pip. Run the following command in your terminal:
   ```
   pip install zulip
   ```
ini [zulip] email=BOT'S EMAIL ADDRESS key=BOT'S API KEY site=ZULIP SERVER URL

[zulip]
email=BOT'S EMAIL ADDRESS
key=BOT'S API KEY
site=ZULIP SERVER URL
python import zulip

Pass the path to your zuliprc file here.
client = zulip.Client(config_file="/path/to/your/zuliprc")

Echo back messages
def handle_message(message, client): content = message['content'] client.send_message({ "type": message['type'], "to": message['display_recipient'], "content": content, })

client.call_on_each_message(handle_message)

```
import zulip

# Pass the path to your zuliprc file here.
client = zulip.Client(config_file="/path/to/your/zuliprc")

# Echo back messages
def handle_message(message, client):
    content = message['content']
    client.send_message({
        "type": message['type'],
        "to": message['display_recipient'],
        "content": content,
    })

client.call_on_each_message(handle_message)
```

bash python bot.py


Your bot should now be running and responding to messages.```bash
python bot.py

# 11. What framework does Zulip use for its frontend?

The verified sources do not provide information on the specific framework that Zulip uses for its frontend.
