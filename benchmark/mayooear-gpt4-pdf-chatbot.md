# 1. How do I configure LDAP authentication in Zulip?

Tell Zulip how to connect to your LDAP server by filling out the section of your /etc/zulip/settings.py headed "LDAP integration, part 1: Connecting to the LDAP server". If a password is required, put it in /etc/zulip/zulip-secrets.conf by setting auth_ldap_bind_password.

Decide how you want to map the information in your LDAP database to users' account data in Zulip. For each Zulip user, two closely related concepts are their email address and their Zulip username. Either or both of these might be an attribute of the user records in your LDAP database.

Tell Zulip how to map the user information in your LDAP database to the form it needs for authentication. There are three supported ways to set up the username and/or email mapping:

(A) Using email addresses as Zulip usernames, if LDAP has each user's email address:

```
AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = ('zproject.backends.EmailAuthBackend',
                           'zproject.backends.ZulipLDAPAuthBackend')
AUTH_LDAP_USER_ATTR_MAP = {
    "full_name": "cn",
    "avatar": "thumbnailPhoto",
    "email": "mail",
    "custom_profile_field__birthday": "birthDate",
}
AUTH_LDAP_USERNAME_ATTR = "mail"
AUTH_LDAP_REVERSE_EMAIL_SEARCH = True
```

(B) Using a custom attribute as the Zulip username:

```
AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = ('zproject.backends.EmailAuthBackend',
                           'zproject.backends.ZulipLDAPAuthBackend')
AUTH_LDAP_USER_ATTR_MAP = {
    "full_name": "cn",
    "avatar": "thumbnailPhoto",
    "email": "mail",
    "custom_profile_field__birthday": "birthDate",
    "username": "uid",
}
(C) Using a custom function to generate the Zulip username:

AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = ('zproject.backends.EmailAuthBackend',
                           'zproject.backends.ZulipLDAPAuthBackend')
AUTH_LDAP_USER_ATTR_MAP = {
    "full_name": "cn",
    "avatar": "thumbnailPhoto",
    "email": "mail",
    "custom_profile_field__birthday": "birthDate",
}
AUTH_LDAP_USERNAME_FUNCTION = 'zproject.backends.ldap_auth.zulip_ldap_user_username'
```

Synchronize data from LDAP into Zulip via the following management command: /home/zulip/deployments/current/manage.py sync_ldap_user_data. We recommend running this command in a regular cron job to pick up changes made on your LDAP server.

# 2. How do I import Slack workspace export into a Zulip organization?

To import a Slack workspace export into a Zulip organization, you should follow the import instructions provided by Zulip. First, you need to install a new Zulip server and skip Step 3. Then, you can import your data from Slack by following the instructions provided in the Zulip documentation for importing from Slack. Once you have your data export tarball, you can log in to a shell on your Zulip server as the zulip user and run the import commands, replacing the filename with the path to your data export tarball. Note that this process could take several minutes depending on how much data you're importing.

# 3. How do I upgrade my Zulip instance to the latest Git version?
Log in to your Zulip server and run the following command as root:

/home/zulip/deployments/current/scripts/upgrade-zulip-from-git main
This will upgrade your Zulip instance to the latest version from the main branch.

If you have made any modifications to the Zulip code, you can push them to your fork on GitHub and use upgrade-zulip-from-git to install the changes. First, checkout a new branch and make your modifications:

```
cd zulip
git checkout -b my-branch main
# Make your modifications
git commit -a
git push origin my-branch
```

Then, log in to your Zulip server and run the following command as root:

/home/zulip/deployments/current/scripts/upgrade-zulip-from-git my-branch
This will install your modifications on the Zulip instance.

Note that upgrading will result in brief downtime for the service, which should be under 30 seconds unless there is an expensive database migration involved. If downtime is problematic for your organization, consider testing the upgrade on a backup in advance, doing the final upgrade at off hours, or buying a support contract.

# 4. How do I create a self-signed SSL certificate for my Zulip server?

To generate a self-signed SSL certificate for an already-installed Zulip server, run the following commands:

sudo -s  # If not already root
/home/zulip/deployments/current/scripts/setup/generate-self-signed-cert HOSTNAME
where HOSTNAME is the domain name (or IP address) to use on the generated certificate.

# 5. How do I delete a Zulip organization?

To delete a Zulip organization, you'll need to access the management shell and run the command `./manage.py delete_realm <realm_name>`. Replace `<realm_name>` with the name of the organization you want to delete. Note that this action is irreversible and will permanently delete all data associated with the organization. Make sure to back up any important data before proceeding.

# 6. Can you explain the rough working of Zulip?

Zulip is a real-time team chat application that provides a great experience for a wide range of organizations, from companies to volunteer projects to groups of friends. It has hundreds of features and supports dedicated apps for iOS, Android, Linux, Windows, and macOS, all modern web browsers, several cross-protocol chat clients, and numerous dedicated Zulip API clients (e.g., bots). Zulip uses GitHub for source control and code review, and has two implementations of Markdown. The backend implementation is based on Python-Markdown and is used to authoritatively render messages to HTML, while the frontend implementation is in JavaScript and is used to preview and locally echo messages the moment the sender hits Enter, without waiting for round trip from the server. Zulip operates under a group mentorship model, and program participants work on a variety of issues in their areas of interest, from major features to small bugs. Many program participants stay involved with the project past the official end of the program.

# 7. Can you describe Zulip architecture, as in, its inner working?
Zulip is primarily implemented in the Django Python web framework and uses Tornado for the real-time push system. It is a real-time team chat application that can host multiple Zulip realms (organizations), each on its own (sub)domain. Each organization is a private chamber with its own users, streams, customizations, and so on. Zulip supports dedicated apps for iOS, Android, Linux, Windows, and macOS, all modern web browsers, several cross-protocol chat clients, and numerous dedicated Zulip API clients (e.g., bots). The main Zulip codebase is at https://github.com/zulip/zulip, which contains the Zulip backend (written in Python 3.x and Django), the web app (written in JavaScript and TypeScript), and the library of incoming webhook integrations with other services and applications. Zulip Mobile is the official mobile Zulip client supporting both iOS and Android, written in JavaScript with React Native, and Zulip Desktop is the official Zulip desktop client for macOS, Linux, and Windows. Zulip Terminal is the official terminal-based client.

# 8. Can you describe an overview of Zulip architecture?
Zulip is primarily implemented in the Django Python web framework and also makes use of Tornado for the real-time push system. The Zulip server can host multiple Zulip realms (organizations), each on its own (sub)domain. Each organization is a private chamber with its own users, streams, customizations, and so on. Zulip supports dedicated apps for iOS, Android, Linux, Windows, and macOS, all modern web browsers, several cross-protocol chat clients, and numerous dedicated Zulip API clients (e.g., bots). The architecture of Zulip is shown in the image "architecture-simple.png" in the Components section of the overview.
