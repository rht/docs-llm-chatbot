# 1. How do I configure LDAP authentication in Zulip?
(review: "restart the Zulip server to apply the changes" needs to be last step, not early on. Mendable-2023-June-18 correctly puts this last. This is WORSE than Mendable-2023-June-18. (-))
To configure LDAP authentication in Zulip, you need to follow these steps:

- Open the /etc/zulip/settings.py file on your Zulip server.
- Look for the AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS setting and add zproject.backends.ZulipLDAPAuthBackend to the list of backends.
- Save the settings.py file.
- Restart the Zulip server to apply the changes.

Now, you need to connect Zulip to your LDAP server. Here's how:

- In the same settings.py file, find the section titled "LDAP integration, part 1: Connecting to the LDAP server".
- Fill out the necessary information, such as the LDAP server URL, base DN, and bind DN.
- If a password is required, set it in the /etc/zulip/zulip-secrets.conf file using the auth_ldap_bind_password parameter.
- Save the settings.py and zulip-secrets.conf files.
- Next, you need to map the user information in your LDAP database to Zulip's authentication requirements:

- Decide whether you want to use email addresses or LDAP usernames as Zulip usernames.
- Based on your decision, configure the AUTH_LDAP_USER_SEARCH setting to query by email address or LDAP username.
- If using email addresses, set the AUTH_LDAP_REVERSE_EMAIL_SEARCH setting to the same query but with %(email)s as the search parameter.
- Set the AUTH_LDAP_USERNAME_ATTR setting to the name of the LDAP attribute for the user's LDAP username in the search result.

After completing these steps, save the settings.py file and restart the Zulip server. Users will then be able to log in to Zulip using their email address and LDAP password.

Please note that these instructions are a summary. For more detailed information and additional configuration options, please refer to the official Zulip documentation.

# 2. How do I import Slack workspace export into a Zulip organization?
(Review. Base article is https://zulip.com/help/import-from-slack. Both Mendable-2023-June-18 and Fini-2023-Sep-07 are not satisfactory here, because they don't include the crucial step to convert the Slack data to Zulip data. TIE)

To import a Slack workspace export into a Zulip organization, you can follow these steps:

Install a new Zulip server, but skip Step 3 (as you'll create your Zulip organization via the data import tool instead). Make sure the Zulip server you're importing into is running the same version as the server you're exporting from.

Upgrade to zulip-cloud-current if you're exporting from Zulip Cloud (zulip.com). You can do this by running the following command:

```
/home/zulip/deployments/current/scripts/upgrade-zulip-from-git zulip-cloud-current
```

If your new Zulip server is meant to fully replace a previous Zulip server, you may want to copy some settings from /etc/zulip to your new server. Copy /etc/zulip/settings.py and /etc/zulip/zulip.conf for sure. Be cautious when copying secrets from /etc/zulip/zulip-secrets.conf.

Log in to a shell on your Zulip server as the zulip user. Run the following commands, replacing the filename with the path to your data export tarball:

```
cd ~
tar -xf /path/to/export/file/zulip-export-zcmpxfm6.tar.gz
cd /home/zulip/deployments/current
./manage.py import '' ~/zulip-export-zcmpxfm6
```

This process will import the Slack workspace export into your Zulip organization. Make sure to replace /path/to/export/file/zulip-export-zcmpxfm6.tar.gz with the actual path to your export file.

If you have any further questions or need more assistance, feel free to ask!

# 3. How do I upgrade my Zulip instance to the latest Git version?
(Review. The first 4 steps are hallucination. This is WORSE than Mendable-2023-June-18. (-))

To upgrade your Zulip instance to the latest Git version, you can follow these steps:

- Make sure you have Git installed and configured on your system.
- Clone the Zulip Git repository to your local machine using the command: git clone https://github.com/zulip/zulip.git
- Navigate to the cloned repository: cd zulip
- Checkout the latest version of Zulip using the command: git checkout master
- Pull the latest changes from the remote repository: git pull origin master
- Run the upgrade script to apply the changes: /home/zulip/deployments/current/scripts/upgrade-zulip-from-git master

This process will fetch the latest changes from the Git repository and upgrade your Zulip instance accordingly. Make sure to replace master with the specific branch or commit you want to upgrade to if needed.

Please note that upgrading from a Git repository may have additional considerations and steps compared to upgrading to a release version. It's recommended to review the Zulip documentation for more detailed instructions and troubleshooting tips specific to upgrading from a Git repository.

# 4. How do I create a self-signed SSL certificate for my Zulip server?
(Review. The answer is for manual creation of the SSL certificate. It didn't recommend the simpler `generate-self-signed-cert`, which Mendable-2023-June-18 does. This is WORSE than Mendable-2023-June-18's. (-))

To create a self-signed SSL certificate for your Zulip server, you can follow these steps:

Open a terminal on your server and navigate to the directory where you want to generate the certificate.

Run the following command to generate a private key:

openssl genrsa -out zulip.key 2048

This command will generate a 2048-bit RSA private key and save it in a file called "zulip.key".

Next, run the following command to generate a certificate signing request (CSR):

openssl req -new -key zulip.key -out zulip.csr

This command will prompt you to enter some information, such as your organization's details. Fill in the required information and save the CSR file.

Now, generate the self-signed certificate using the following command:

openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in zulip.csr -signkey zulip.key -out zulip.crt

This command will generate a self-signed certificate that is valid for 365 days and save it in a file called "zulip.crt".

Finally, copy the generated key and certificate files to the appropriate location on your Zulip server. Typically, you would place the key file at /etc/ssl/private/zulip.key and the certificate file at /etc/ssl/certs/zulip.crt.

Remember that using a self-signed certificate is not recommended for production environments, as it may not be trusted by web browsers and can pose security risks. It is best to obtain a trusted SSL certificate from a certificate authority (CA) for production use.

# 5. How do I delete a Zulip organization?
(Review. https://zulip.com/help/deactivate-your-organization. This answer is a hallucination. There is no "danger zone", nor "delete organization" button. There is only "deactivate organization". Mendable-2023-June-18's answer, which is for a self-hosted version, is better. This is WORSE than Mendable-2023-June-18. (-))

To delete a Zulip organization, you need to be an organization administrator. Here are the steps to delete the organization:

- Log in to your Zulip organization as an administrator.
- Go to the "Organization settings" page by clicking on the gear icon in the top-right corner and selecting "Organization settings" from the dropdown menu.
- Scroll down to the "Danger zone" section at the bottom of the page.
- Click on the "Delete organization" button.
- A confirmation dialog will appear asking you to confirm the deletion. Read the warning carefully and make sure you understand the consequences of deleting the organization.
- If you still want to proceed with the deletion, type the name of your organization in the confirmation box and click on the "Delete organization" button.
- Your Zulip organization will be permanently deleted, and all data associated with it will be lost. This action cannot be undone, so make sure you have a backup of any important information before proceeding.
Please note that these instructions are based on the current stable release of Zulip. If you are using a development version, there may be changes in the process. It's always a good idea to refer to the latest documentation for the most accurate instructions.

# 9. How do I get an account's username via the Zulip Python API?
(Review. The code is badly formatted, but it is still intelligible. This is BETTER than Mendable-2023-June-18. (+))

To get an account's username via the Zulip Python API, you can use the zulip.Client class and the get_user method. Here's an example:

```
# Initialize the Zulip clientclient = zulip.Client(config_file="~/zuliprc")

# Get the user's informationuser_info = client.get_user(email="user@example.com")

# Extract the username from the user's informationusername = user_info["user"]["username"]

# Print the usernameprint(username)
```

Make sure to replace "user@example.com" with the actual email address of the account you want to retrieve the username for. Also, ensure that you have a valid zuliprc configuration file in the specified location or provide the correct path to your zuliprc file.

This code will fetch the user's information using the provided email address and then extract the username from the response. Finally, it will print the username to the console.
